# OTX Commercial Licensing

The standard version of OTX is licensed under the **AGPLv3**. This means if you use OTX in your application:
1. You must liberate your source code.
2. You cannot use it in proprietary/closed-source commercial products without sharing your code.

## 💼 Enterprise License (Commercial)

If you wish to use **OTX-Max** in a proprietary/commercial environment (e.g., Logistics platforms, High-Frequency Trading, proprietary ML pipelines) without open-sourcing your code, you must purchase a Commercial License.
